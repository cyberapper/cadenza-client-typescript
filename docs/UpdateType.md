# UpdateType

How the client should apply the order book payload.  - `SNAPSHOT`: Full state of the book at `timestamp`. Client replaces its local view. - `DIFF`: Incremental change since previous message. Client applies per-level: zero quantity removes the level, non-zero upserts. - `DELTA`: Reconciliation delta against a known reference state (venue-specific semantics — document per-connector). 

## Enum

* `Snapshot` (value: `'SNAPSHOT'`)

* `Diff` (value: `'DIFF'`)

* `Delta` (value: `'DELTA'`)
